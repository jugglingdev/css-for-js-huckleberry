## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS float layout

### What I learned

In this challenge, I tackled solving the Huckleberry workshop with only float layout. That's right, no flexbox, grid, absolute positioning, `calc`, CSS variables, media queries or other advanced techniques. The purpose here was to get good at the basics: margin, padding, and border.

### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to build my discernment of when float layout works and when advanced techniques like flexbox and grid are needed. I just to flexbox pretty quickly, so it would be nice to simplify when that's not needed.
